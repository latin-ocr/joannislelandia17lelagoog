both hin Head and Body were transsated to Kingston in the
same County of Suffolk, where, in Honour of him, a very
great Church was built, wrought with a wonderful Frame of
Timber, whence it began to be called Sansti Edmundi Bur·
gur», and afterwards St. Edmundbury and Bury. At length
King Canntns being touched with a Sense of the wickedness
os his father Swenus, and being more particularly concern'd
at his Sacrilegious Im piety towards this Church, which struck
the more deeply upon his Fancy by reason of a Vilion of St.
Edmund that appeared to him, he built the whole Church
&new in a much more beautiful and regular Mamer, and
the Fabriclt beia} finilhed, he adorned it with a great many
Royal Gifts, ered his own Crown to the Holy Martyr,
brought into it Monks with their Abbat, and endowed it
with many fair and large Mannors, and (aniongst them)
with all *the Town it sels. Then the Holy King and Martyr
was laid in a goodly Shrine, set with ewels and pretioue
Stonee. He was martyred, according to ome Anthors, on the
12³³. cal. Dec. A. D. 866. according to others A. D. 870. bnt
according to the Account in the Decem Scriptores A. D. 80 ς.
His Peast is celebrated on the zoth. of November.

The Church having receiv’d such HonourS, it arose by
Degreoe to that Splendour and Magnificence, that it was ex·
ceeded by very few. There was a constant Resort of Stran-
εει-ε aud others to the Place partly out of Respe& to the Me·
mory of the Royal Mai-tyr, and partly out of a Defign to gra·
tisy their Curiofity. This was one of the Places that were
visited by our groet Antiquary Mr. Leland, and that the
Rader may have a more lively Representation of it, 1 shall
transcribe his Words as they are cited by Mr. Weever ⁸ who
was himself likewise a very diligent and curione Preserver of
Antiquities. ‘⁴ The Suune, saith this eminent Person, heth
“ not seene either a Citie more finely stated, (so delicately
‘⁸ standeth it upon the eafie ascent, or hanging of an hill,
“ and a little river runneth downe on the East side thereof)
“ or a goodlier Abbey 3 whether a man indIfferently consider,
⁰⁸ either the endo-arment with revenues, or the largenesse, or
‘⁴ the incomparable magnificence thereos. A man that saw
‘⁸ the Abbey would say verily it were a Citie: so many gates
‘⁸ there are in it, and some of basse, so many Towers, and
‘⁸ a most stately Church: upon which attend θ three others
‚⁶⁸ also standing glorioussy in one and the same Church yardg
⁸⁴ all of paffing fine and curious Workmanlhip.”

There were buried in this Church, besides St. Edmund
