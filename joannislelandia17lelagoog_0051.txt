0 that to satisfie the curiosity of those, who are willing

to know, when, by whom, and for whom these Religious
nouses were Founded, (the Majesty of whose very mines
strike Travellers with admiration t) To preserve some re·
membranoe of these structum, once the Giory of our English
Nation, and of their Founders, that so highly deserved of the
several Ages they lived in, is the defign of this Book. Tho’
1 am not ignorant, that the generality of peopie, eve ’‘sinoe
the Diffolution, have, thro’ a mistaken zeal, and fal e pre-
judice, thought, that the very memory qf those Great Men,
who erested these placeS, ought to be buried in the rubbisst
of those StrustureS, that they designed should perpetuate their
Naum to Eternity. Thus, they have been always censured..
as weii wilhere to the introducing of Popery, who enda-
voured to give any account os Monasteries. Such unjust and
ill-natured Refleftions have been the principa} easons that
have deterred several of our Historians from discoursing so
largely about them, as they could, or indeed their occasions
required ς and have been the chief causes why so few have
treath purposely of them, or published any things immedi-
ately relating to them or theit LandS. 'Tis well known, Μ’.
Camden ⁸ and Μ’. Weever t» were forced to apologize for
barely mentioning the Monasteries3 and what outcries were
made upon the Publication of that glot-lons work the Mona·
sticon ι’ In so much that a very Learned and ingenious person
ε wrote a Latin Letter to D‘. Langbain (to whom Μ’. Dug-
dale had communicated his Collec'tions) to encourage the
design, by shewiog the great use os such a work, and remov-
ing all objections that could be raised against it. Which is-
printed in some few Copies of the first Volume. Nay, so
much are some people possess'd against them, that the least
mentionis odious and ungratefui. But there are no grounds
for it3 seeing these reiigione places were by the well in-
tended charity of their Founders and Benefaftors built, en-
dowed and adorned (how much soever they were afterward
abused) to the glory of God, the service of Religion, and
the reiief of poor Christians. But 1 would not be thought in
this or any other expressions that may be found in this dis·
course, in the least to vindicate the superstition or vices of the
Monks3 tho’ pethaps it would be but common justice to iti-¹
fuse mtter- opinion of Monasteries into· the generality of
Prot ts.
