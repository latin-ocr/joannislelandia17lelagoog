Pet-sons of the best Qality and highest Dignity.

The Abbey Chul-ch ⁸ (which was first built by Harold and
afterwards reedified by Henry ΙΙ.) was a Gothick Building
rather large than neat,- firm than fair-2 The great Pillars now

with Brass, which added much to the Beauty of the Buildiug.
The Steeple stood in the middle of the Ghurch3 but being ⁴
pulled down, the foundations of it were blown up by
undermiuers‚ and the whole Choir3 part, the eross mes.
and the East Chapell of the Chureh were demoliihed, and
so nothing off it was left standing, save the West End of the
Bady of it (with the Side Isses) which is about 30. Yards
long, and 16. Yards broad, and is fince the Dissolution be·b
come the Parochial Churcb, and is adorned by the Patimi-
oners nt their own Cost δ with a Tower Steeple, which is
built at , the west End, and is 86. Feet in height from the
foundation to the Battlements. .

Tho’ Fuller hath publifhed the History of this Abbey, yet
he hath negleRed to give an Aoeount of it's Abbats; which
ue 1 look, upon nn a very great Omiffion, sol admire the more
at it, because 1 had an opportunity of extraffing excellent
Materials about them from the Leiger Book of this Abbey‚
in the Custody of the Right Honourable the Earl of Carlisse
written by Roberx F ulier the last Abbat. Had he iniarged
his Histoi-y by inserting a Chapter upon this Subjest, he would
have deserved much better of those Readers that have the
Curiofity ogfferufin what he bath done about this Place,
and he wo have ved me some Pains, which I must now
be obliged to undergo, in order to supply this Defest of his
History, 1 must confess that 1 have not as yet had the Per..
usal of the said Leiger Book3 and yet the Evidences Ι have
met with have furniihed me so well, that I·have good rag
fon to think that, upon a nice aud critical Examination‚
zhfire {vill 1Ἑὶ be found many confidet-able Mistakes in the

Abbats.
