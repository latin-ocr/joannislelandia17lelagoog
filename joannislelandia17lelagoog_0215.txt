' γ’ 'A View‘ of the Mitred Abbeys‚

John Morgwent, alias Mangeant, Canon of Hereford‚ who
being shorn MonkS, were solemnly here interred after their
Death's; as were Humfrey Bohun Earl of Hereford, ⁸ Strong·
bowe’s wife Conntcss of Pembroke (who, it is thought, lay
where Abbat Malverne afterwards had his Tomb) and Ga·
mage aKnight of Wales and his wife, who were both bu·
ried in a Chapell in the North East Part of the Body of the
Church. But this Church having escaped the Fury of those
that contrived and carried on the Diffolution, and continu.-
ing now intire. all but the Chapter-Hense, 1 {hau referv the
Reader for a more fun Account of it to Sir Robert Atkins’s
-Ancient and present State of Gloucester-sttire‚ and will only =
borrow from Leland b these Inscriptions, written on the
walls of the said demolisszed chapter-House‚ which are omit.

The Eiegancy of the Strufture of the Abbey Church may
best be viewed by the several Draughts of it 3 but the Dimen-
fions of it being not given us there, Inmn take the opportunity
of gratifying the Reader in that Particular. The Length of
the Church and of our Lady’s Chapess is 420. Feet3 the
Breadth of the Church and of the lsses is 84. Feet, equal to
which is the Height stom the Area of the Pavement to the
T op of the Choir. The Height of the Tower is 222. Feet‚
and the Square of the Cloysters is ¹50· Feet.

Touching the. Bnilding of this Church, the Description of
it falling best under each respective Abbat, Ι st1a11 reserve my
Observations ’till Icome to speak of them pand will only
here subjoyn from Leland ⁶, that the South Isse and the Choir
were made by Oblations done at the Tomb of King Edw. 11.
>and that one Osbern ἀ, Cellas-er of Gloucester, made, not long
before Mr. Leiand's time, a fair new Tower or Gate House

·at the South West Part of the Abbey Cemitery. The Abbats

of this Place had divers goodly Seme, as at ⁶ Pinkeness‚ οι·
