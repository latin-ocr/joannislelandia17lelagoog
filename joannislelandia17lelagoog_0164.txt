-nre still standing, and are very near this' Toiver. 'One of

· them is dedicated to All-SaintS, and the other to St. Laurence.
Neithcr of them bath any Reus, but the Bells in the Abbey
Tower serve for the use of both. One of them, viz. Saint
Laurence’S, is officiated in the Morning, and All-Saints in
the Afternoon, all the Summer Seas0n; but in Winter time
there is very rarely divine Service performed in St. Laurence’s
Church, that of All-saints being only frequented. Both
these Churches have small Spire SteepleS, and IsseS, and Bo—
dys, all which are leaded, and with St. Bengworth on the
other fide of the Water (which is likewise a Spire) and the
Abbey Tower they afford a good ancl pleasant Prospe& from
Blockley Hills adjacent. At the upper End of the South Isse
of All-Saints is a small Chapell built by Abbat Lichfeild.
lt is arched at Top with Stone, and carved, and under an
Arch are the initial Letters of his Name C. L. for Clement
Lichfeild. At the Entrance into it is a Grey Marble, on
which was the said Abbat’s Portraiture and an Inscription
under it in Brass, which are torn off. In the Church of St.
Lam-enee at the End of each Isse on each Side the Body of
the Chnrch are two Chapells‚ which seem to have been· built
about the same time as that of All-saints, viz. not long be·
fore the Diffolution. ·

Leiand bath infor-med π ue, that in the foresaid Tower was
a great Bell, and a goodly Clock ; but 1 have not been able
to lam what is become of this Clock-Bell novit, tho' 1 sup·
pose that it continued ’till the Restauration of King Chat-les
the Second, when the Youth of the Town joyning together,
and taking the Bells out of the two Parilh steeples, melted
them and coined the present Ring of eight Belle, now hang·
ing together in the Tower‚ as l have before infinuated.

On, or near the Site of the Abbey is built a neat House,
in which itis supposed the old Stone was employed. They
have no Tradition here of the Abbey Church, CloysterS, or
Chapter-House3 but in the Cemitery near Saint Laurence's
Church is an old Arch yet standing in Ruins, which perhaps
might have been some part of the Abbey Buildings. There
are no memorable Monuments in either of the Parisst
ChurcheS. ,
