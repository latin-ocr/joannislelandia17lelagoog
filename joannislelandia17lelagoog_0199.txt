4¹ . Rxcnaan nn Satnonnf to have been Abbat of this
Place. He died ΑΟ. 1 4¹ 5. 3ηά was succeeded the same Year by

42. Jonn Donsm ὅ, who continued, I suppose, to the.
Year 1421. when

43. R1cflaat> Boxonss ¹¹ was eleaed Abbat. He died ΑΟ.
1426. and was succeeded by

44. Tuo. Sans-021) ἰ, who resigned ΑΟ. 1428. and was

45. ΚΛΜ·- ΗΑΜΜΕ ¹³, who was elested Αἱ 1429. He re-
figned A0. ¹43 5. and was succeeded by
, 46. W11.1.. Asnaum-:n ¹. Hem and his Success‘or john
Sante, with his two immediate Predeceffors Hamme and Sal·
ford built the Tower in the middle of the Church, au the
Body of the Chai-ch, and the Towers at the West End of it.
And it was he withan and Sante ‘³ that built the intire West

48. yl'hxo. Rownmn q, who died ΑΟ. 1503. and was suc-
ceeded the same Year by

49. Anxanntnsaowxsnnooxr. If we follow Godwin
Miles Salley {hould be placed somewhere hereabouts in this
List. For he tells s us, that he was first Abbat of Abbington,
then Abbat of Eynstmm, and made Bissmp of Landaffe A0.
ι 504. But Leland observes ⁸, that he was only Almoner of
Abbington, and therefore 1 think he is very justly to be left
out in this catalogue. As for Shottilbrook he died Ao. 1 508.
and was succeeded the same Year by
