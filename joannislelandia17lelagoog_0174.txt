A great part of this Church was left standing after the Dis·
solution for a Parochial Church 3 but it hath been fince so
miset-ably defaoed, that little remains save the Body and
South Isse which archowever ruinous and uncovered at Top,
ond there is nothing more to be seen save only part of the
North me, which is used as the Parim Chnmh, and is in
[affigo. Feet and 24. in Breadth. We cannot form to
om· a better Idea of the Magnificence of this Church
than from the Draught that is published in the Monasticon ⁶,
¹which is near double the Length of what serves now for the
Pniffi church, being 140. Feet 10:233 and yet even this‘
vas not above a third Part of the Church when it stood in
ἰὴ Gbry and Prosperity before the Dissolution. For this
Represeutntiou only contains the West Part 'of it from the
'Ptnseptmm or great crosa me, which extende-d it self from
North to Sonth ς and in the middle of this Building was an
high Spin-e Steeple, beyond which was the Eastern Part or
cheir, which >appears by the Foundation to have been neat
