Rome. Had he therq‘qre put a Stop to those ErrorS, be had
alred wisely, and very much to the Cantent qs all tr-uly good
and religious Men. But then this would not have fittisfyed
the Ena: of himself, and his ,eovetous and ambitione. Ageuts,
They all aimed at the Revenues and Riches of the Religious
Houses, for which reason no Arts nor &utrivances were te
be paffl‘d by that might be of use in obtaining those Ends. The
' most abominable Crimes were to be charged upon the Religious,
“ and the Charge was to be managed with the utmost Industry,
Boldnes3‚ and Dexterity. This was a pomerful Argument to
draw an Odium upon them, and tq make them dist'ffffed and
ridiculed by the Generality eff Mankind. And yet after all,
’ the Profft were so insufficient‚ that from what I have been
, able to guther I bave not found any dire& one against even
any fingle Monastery. Ue Sins ‘ff one or two particular Per·
sons do not make a Sodom. Neither are violent and forced
Conseffions to be estemed as the true Refidts ff any ones thoughts..
When therffore even these Artifices would not do, the last Ex·
pedient was put in Execution, and that was Ejeetion by force,
and to make the innocent sufferet-s the more content, Penfions
were settled κρρη many, and such Peufions were, in some mea·
sure, proportioned to their Innocenoe. Thus by degrees the Rev
ligious Honse3‚ and the Estates belonging to them, being sut·-

tiny other voluntary Injury to the Religious Houses. I could
