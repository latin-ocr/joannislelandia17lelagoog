'l'hele Monks, which are ²4· in Number, had their Pen-
fiens affigoed them per litt. Patentes sub sigillo curiae Augm.
datas 23. Febr. A0. 29. H. 8. lrrotulatas in libro pensionum
notato A. isizsfol. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And that both these, a:
well as those abovementioned of the Monks of Battell‚ were
large Penfions, and not small ones, I think will be evident
enough to such as shall compare the Prizes of Thlngs now
with what they were formerly ς in order to which 1 think fit
to obser-ve, that in perufing the Parmer of Ravenston's At:-x
tounts for the Impropriatio‘n and vicaridge of Ravenston
granted with that Monastery to Cardinal Wolsey, 1 find that
the Parmer by way of Discou'nt to our College of chdsts · .
Chureh (then called cardinal College) to which the said ’
Monassery was then given,‘ reckons but 11. 6s. sd. for the
'Vicat-’s Diet for the whole Year. So that five pounds per an.
'theu (which was the lowest of the Penfiohs here mentnonecL
and there' was 00 one so low in the Abbey of Battell except ·
Ladd‘s) would maintaln any one in great Honour and Cre·
dit, and may therefore be very justly looked upon asa very
good Argument, that both these Places were, by no means
guilty of those black Crimes of which they are accused
*their unreasonable Adversariee. Had the Pensions been 0
figned to Persons altogether different from thosethat sub·
scribed the surrender, there would have been some Groundt
for the Accusations, tho· truly· good Men would not even
from such Grounds have been willing to believe them guilty.
But now that therewere really 00 such Grounds, will (as 1 taxe
