Α Letter to the Publisher from the·

learned Roonn GALE Esq3 occa-

fioned by his Effay‚ towards tlse Re-

covety qf the Comfes of the som·

Great Roman W ays·‚ printed in tiae
Sixth Vol. of Leland’s ltin.

S 1 R, Scruton August rst. 1 714.

H 0’ Ι have thus long deferred my thanks for your
Company when I was last at Oxsord, Ι will assure
you 1 was no ways unmindful either of that, or the
promise I made you of sending the several additions
Ι had made to m'y former Effiy upon the Roman
Roads. 1 then acquainted you with my mistake about the
Fqffe netu· Leicester, occasioned by the names of Foston and
Great and Little Strettongiven to three Towns lying on the
East fide of the River Soar, which millmd me being an en·
tire Stranger in those parts when 1 wrote that piae, and
having no information from any of our Writers for the par·
ticular course of it thro' that County. As in my Journey to

the Bath 1 had the good fortune to recover the whole tra& ·

of it from Leicester to Highcross (which is now rebuilt with
a fine Colnmn of free Stone) so in my return 1 had the fa·
tisfaCtion of tracing it back from Leicqster till it brings yon
near Wlloughby in the Wolds, whereI lost it before. The par·
ticulars of the whole you {han have below in it's proper
place, and shall onely here tell you my thoughts that the
above mentioned Foston and Strettons may have had their
names from some Via Vicinalis leading out of the Foffe, pc r-
haps to Bur-tow, taken by some to be the Vernemetum of
Antoninus.

The first addition I defire may be after the wordsormcr,
the last line of the 97⁶¹. page, as follows ε ”

“ But this may be an argument that our Historinns had their
‘⁶ account of these ways from some Author, οι· Tradition in
“ being before the time of King Athelstan‚ who divide-d that
‘⁸ Country into Cornwall and Dema-(hire, it being but oue
‘⁶ Province till his reign.’'
