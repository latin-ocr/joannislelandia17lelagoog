But however this Inscription did not prote& either this, σι·
any other of the Bells from Sacrilege. For there are now
none left belonging to the Abbey Church. and those which
serve for the Use of the Paristt are in a lonely Spire Steeple
of one of the two ancient Pafirh Chnrches at the End of the
Church Yard, the Church belonging to which hath long finoe
been made a Dwelling for poor People. The inhabitants
out of the regni-d they had to King Athenian, who was the
Fonnder of all the Priviiegae, have in memory of him put up
in the Abbey Church an Effigies 1n Stone3 but 1 am not sure
whether it be the same that belonged to the Tomb, which
was in the East Part of the Church.

The Monumentsof the Saxon Saints and other Persons bn-
ricd here, such as ⁸ St. Maildun or Maidulfi St. Adelm‚ and
St. johannes Sapiens, are intirely destroyed, and there is not
one ancient Inscription left standing.

In this Abbey, as we learn from Anglia Sacra, was buried
John Giffard‚ Founder of St. Benedici College and Gloucef-
ter-Hall in Onford.
