Hereford δ. Tho· Grafton, Hall, and some others represent
'him as an illiterate Person, yet the contrary will appear to
'such as lhall have the opportunity of perufing a Book (which
1 lately saw) intitled The Art orerft qf Rhetorick, written by
Leonard Cox Schoolmaster of Reading. It was printed in the
beforenarned Year 15²4· and is dedicated by the Author
to this Abbat. Cox was a Man universally celebrated for
his Learning and Eloquence. He is one of laland’s Wor-
thies ⁶. He was every way capable of making a true J edg-
ment of other Mens Abilities‚ and he was so just a Man
himself that there is no reason to suspect him guilty of Par·
tiality. He speaks very worthily ‚and honour-ably of Fan-lng-
-don upon account of his Learning. And his Character in
this respect ir» to be credited rather than that given by the
other Writers 1 have mentioned, who were not competent
{ridges of true Learning. Flattery was not so much now in
vogue as it hath been fince. Authors in the Bufiness of De·
«dications (especially wisc one8‚ such as Gox certainly was)
«thought it a very great Blemilh to their own Reputation, as
well as an Affront to their Patrone, to write any thing con-
trary to Truth in their Addressea. For which reason we rnay
safely conclude that what Cox heth offered in the Dedica-
tion of this Book is litterally true. But the Book is become
now so very rare, that even some of the most industrious
Searchers after the learned Remains of our Engliih Writers
have not been able to meet with it. The compilet of
Athenae Oxon. was very lucky in his Inquit-ies this way.
And yet he could not find, or hear of, so much· as one Copy
of this Book, and upon that Accounnhe bath said nothing
of it in his Discourse about our Anthor d. This Faringdon
continued Abbat ’till the Diffolution, when⁶ in the Month
of Nov. A0. 1539. he was with two of his Monks, named
Rugg and Onion, hang’d, drawn, and quaroered at Reading,

and was the last Abbat of tbisMonastery,
