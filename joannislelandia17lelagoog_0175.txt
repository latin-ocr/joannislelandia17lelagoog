'A View of the Mitred Abbqu
carrying S. Guthlac to Heaven, all which were gilded fot·-

‘ merly. In this Tower hang five small Bells, the fourleast of

which were cast out of three A⁰. 1654. On the biggest is
this Inscription in ancient Charafters: In multis annis resonet
campana Johannis. But the noted Reus which belonged to
the Abbey hung in the middle Steeple, beforespoken of.

The Monuments being therefore destroyed it is not poffible
for me to be so particular in that respe& as 1 otherwise in·
tended. Ι have however met withsorne, that were here in·
terred‚ and they are these that follow, viz. ·

Waldeve Earl of Huntingdon and Northampton, behmded
by Will. the Conqnemr, and afterwards reputed a Saint. He
was buried near the high Altar under a goodly Monument,
for whom an Inscription of near 30. Verses was made Anno
1219. beginning thus: · ·

Hic, Waldeve comes, tumularis ἐς incineraris,

Parte tamen meliore tui super qstra locaris. διε.
The rest may be seen in Leland ², and a farther account of
him may be found in Dugdale’s Baronage.

Alan de Cruen Lord of Triston. He was buried on the
South fide of the high Altar.

Watkin Rodeley Esq; that married the Dutchess of Somet-
set. He was alive, as some say in Heu. the Seventh's time.
He was buried in the Lady's Chapell.

Richard Welleby EsquIre of Hen. 7. and Thomas Welleby
his Nephew and Heir. They lay in a goodly Tomb.

The Shrine of St. Guthlac in this Church was very costly 3
but of this, as well as of other Matters relating to this Church,
there is an excellent Account given in Ingulph us (Abbat here-
οἱ) and his Continuer Peter Blesenfis vice-Chaucellor to
Henry the Second. ,Α

The Virgin Mary and St. Bartholomew were accounted
Tutelar Saints of this Monastery. The Pillars of the Church
are large, and curioussy carved, and the Arches are spatians.
Nor is the Bridge of the Town (which is spoken of by Cam·
den) less remarkable, being triangular, and so steep that no
Horseman can well ride over it. It commands the Intercourse

’ of the three Streets of the Town one with another. At the

Foot of it is the Effigies of St. Guthlac cut in Stone. It ia
built in this Fassiion : ο
