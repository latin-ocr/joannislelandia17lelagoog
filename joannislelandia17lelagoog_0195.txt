ι. Hunos ⁸ was the first Abbat here, v1‘z. A·. 67 ς. He
died in the time of King Athelard, and was succeeded by

2. Conauus b, who is also called Cumanus,

3. Rea-nunus ‘² occurrs Abbat next. A0. 8 14. he was ac·
cording to Heylin ‘¹3 made Bishop of Dorchester. Godwin
also notes ² that he was Bistiop of this Hace, but omitte this
Circumstanee of the time of his Advancement, tho· he tells
us that be died Anno 8 51. which Ilook upon as a Mistake.
This is certain that he was succeeded in his Abbatssiip by

4. Cma’rnus f, after whose Death, which fell out after the
Year 831. the Monks forsook this Abbey, and it continued
desolate and ruinous ’till the Year 9 54, when it was restored
by the. means of St. Dunstan, and

ς. ETHELWOLD 8 was appointed Abbat in thatYoer. He

Founder of Abbcys in that Age. He died the first of August
