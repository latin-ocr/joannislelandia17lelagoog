A Vm ffthe mma Abbeys,

fay he was buried at Deepiog. There is no question but
many excellent and very eminent Perseus were buried here
belides, especially such as had a particular Van-:ration md
nouom for the Memor-y of the before mentioned sams, and
could not therefore but delire to have their Bones laid in
the ’same Chnroh where they had been certainly infor-med
they hed been immed before. Their Monuments to bc sure
were equalto their :Dignityg but whatever they were they
underwent the same Fate that most ''l'lzings of this kind did

. et the Diffolution. And yet the Abbey Church it self had

the good Fortnne not to be quite destroyed. For Part of
it being, after the Abbey was' suppreffed, made Paro·
eli-inl, -it ‘bath by that means been preserved, and harh escaped
saerilegions Hamis· This is the Westem Front, which io
about 90. feet in Height and Length, and is adorned with
two round T urrets at each end, eresting themselves near
πο. Feet higher. There is aBeu (of about 1600. poundsin

Α weight) in that on the North Side, which was hung up A*-

1636, when this Building was appropriated (as some say) to
'divine Service, and the middle Isse or Nave of the Church
repited for that purpose. When this Church was, in ἰὴ
Glory, it was at least five times as lange as at present, and had
no doubt n great Crass Issewith a Tower in the middle and
aChnir beyond it, end even that which now remains was
mvelt mre magnificent„ as being higher and better roofed„ ·
ahdthe‘Front being also benntified with several Effigies placed
oet-r the West windoxv (under which is the Eutrance into
the Clmoeh) all which 'are gone except niue, and the two
Side isses me likewise destroyed, and now nothing remains
save the middle one or=Body, which is in Length 66. Feet
and 28. in Breadtb, the Sides whereof are supported by
Wolls built between the Pillars, under the Centers of which
are Windows under those above. But there are no Inscrip-
tinas or Monuments exstant (as I have already hinted ς)
md ns to the Abbey, if any of it be remaining, it is obscuret!
by mlier Building3‚ and s wallowed up with divers Tenements
erested on the Ground thereos, aud nothing is now to be
discovered except a little piece of the Cloyssers in Laength
24.- feet, end to. in Breadth, ,patched up into a School·
Hense. Nor could any thing further be learned of the Inha-
bitants, who. being chiefly Frenehmen, could give little or
no Information of other Buildings, Sec. except that not far
from the Chmch'they shewed a piece of Ground, where
many Urbs ‘and' 'Coyns have been digged up, and amongst.
ube latter divers oi Trajan, very fair and well preserved.
