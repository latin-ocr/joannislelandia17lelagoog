continued so only nine Years, and
then became a Collegiate Church for a Dean and seculae·
canons, who have continued ever fince, except for three
Years in Qeen Mary’s Reign‚ during which time here was
an Abbat aud Benedistine Monks reestablistxed.

Whereas the two preceding Abbeys of Glastonbury and
Canterbury are intirely ruined (which makes it the more diffi-
cult to give a Descriptionof them) this of Westminster bath

and being repriev'd from the all-destroying Axcs and Hammm
of Edward VI, as likewise the Hands of the Duke of Somerset‚
who was then Protector, and laid in rubbilh the magnificent
Abbeys of Glastonbury and Reading (given to him at the
Diffolution) and had a Defign b to have done the like by

Palaces, two Churchae, the Cloysters of St. Paul’s ὅτε. pleaded
it's cause, and purchased it's Rausome. So that being still
standing, we ought to look upon it as the most intire Piece
of building of this kind now to be seen in England, and it
will serve as a Representation of what sumptuous sti-uetares
the other Abbeys were, and how much it would have been
to the Honour and Grandeur of this Notion to have im-

-ploy’d them, like thie, to Religionis Uses.

This Church having therefore providentially escaped, and
so wise and effectual Care having been taken for it’s future
Preservation‚ it would be proper for me in the next Place
to be very particular ln giving a nice and distinct Relation
of every thing belonging to it that may be looked upon as
material and fit to be taken notice of in a Discourse of this
nature3 but large Accounts of it having been already pu·
