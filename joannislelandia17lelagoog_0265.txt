’ 'Prince’s Worthies of Dema-(hire. But this Honour being
given m it very late1y‚ viz. iu the fifth of Heu. 8. it lassed
a very {hort time, being dissolved with the other Abbeys in
the same King‘s Reign. Since which the (jhm-ch, which,
besides our Ladys² Chapell, was an 126 grffes, Faces, οι·
Yards in Lengtb, and was a magnificent Building. is iutireiy
pulled down. The Kitchin, which was left standing of late
YearS, tho’ now raised to the Foundation, was a large square
Romu, open to the Roof, which was composed of elegant
Workmanship. The Chapter-House is likewise ruined. 1oe
was a Pile of great Beauty‚ built as round as can poffiblybe
marked with a Compass·, and yet the Dimenfions thereof
were large, there being 36. Seats in the Infide wrought out
in the walis, ali arch'd over Head with curious carved StoneS.
The Refestory with several of the Offiees is still standing,
being of great Length, Breadth and Heigbt. The Samo
school, which was· erestcd by a laud-ibic Institution, for
reading the Laws and Histories written in our Mother T ongue,
is a large ὓ Building, as is the Area where the Cloysters stood,
which were 4 ς. Paces or Yards in Length‚ the East Side of
which opened into the Chapter-House, and it is probable that
the Church stood on the North Side. In two Arches on the
said North Side of the Cloyssers are oue or two broken Monu-
mentS‚ one ef which Tradition says belong’d to the Founder,
who was here buried, as were his Son (whose Effigieswas of
great Length) and St. Rum'ond‚ a Saxon Saint, to whom and
to St. Μαι-γ the Church was dedicated. Adjoyning to this
North Side of the cioysters is the Cburch-Yard‚ which is
hrge and spatious, and perhaps was the Cemitery of the Ab·
bey as well as the Parish Church, which is agreat Building
with an high T ower at the W est End, and is dedicated to St}
Eustachius. lt seems to have been built not long before the
Diffolution‚ before which in all likelyhood the Pariffiioners had
a Place in the Body of the Abbey. T he Walls of the Abbey
are spatione„ and the Buildings of the Abbacy being strong ”
