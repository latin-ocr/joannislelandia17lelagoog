Were it proper, diuers curicus Obsemtions might ὗε mad'e
upon this Inscripti'on, as well as upon the different Sorte ff
Venas that appear upon the Stoue, which would cotfim
what Ι bave said in my General Preface to this Work. But
I rather leave thefi to the Reader’s better Judgmen t, andstnll,
at present, only note (what ῙρνἰηεὶραΙζγ publsh it herefhr)
that E Η ω· either the fiune as ejus h'onori, or ergo honoriS,
(provided ergo wilt be allowed to stand m the first Place)
and not ejus heredeS, as itstgnfies esewhere. For tho there
were monumenta hereditaria m appositiva to monumenta fa-
miliaria, yet the Expreffion in this Inscription ftems properly
to be un'derstood of an Honour done to the Goddeſs m Perform·
Once osa Vow that bad been made, ex vom, as ’tis hen· worded,

· OT being to be added.
