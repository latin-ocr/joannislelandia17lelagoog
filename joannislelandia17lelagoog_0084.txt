PRAELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. 79

written with his own Hand, and sometimes the Genealogical
Tables and the Notos upon them are done with that exquisite
eareand Judgment, that I cannot bnt think much otherwffie
ff this eminent Perfin than the Author eff Athenae Oxoni·
enses. For it plainly appears to me, that bis Judgment ami
Sagac'uty ψει-ε not inferior to his Diligence, and Iste no reason
to doubt bnt that if he had lived to have written the Anti-
quities of Yorkfhire (as he once designed) it would have ap-
peared in a very pleafing and entertaining Method, and in a
proper, elegant Style‚ and would have beenstt ont with all other
becoming AdvantageS. But instead of methodizing his Col-
lefflons, he thought it more useful (at lensi it sititet! most with
bis Inclination) constant& to continue them on, and to leave
the publication of them in what Order should be thought fit to
Posterity. ,ἳο that tho’ he heaped up such an immense Number
quemnsk8‚ yet he prepared nothing fhr the Press himself ex-
cepting the two first Volnmes of the Monasticon3 but before the
Work was advanced far by the Printer8‚ he was cut off by
Doeth, and then the corret'ting part fell upon the equaliy fa-
mous Sir william Dugdale‚ who added a third Vo.'ume, which
is wholly owing to himseff. What had been published before
about our Religious Houses is extremely ssight and imperfefi.

But in this great Work there is a most noble Account‚ extran-

edfrom the most Anthentick Leiger Books, RegisterS, and

other Record3‚ ff the most corfiderable ‘ff the Religious Ηοιιΐες,

and all is done with ,β much Fidelity, and in sb good a Me·

thod, that there is nothing but what is commendabit· in it. In
fi much that the Work bath been applaudet! and admired not

οηζγ by thosepf our own Nation, but by the mosi judicious and

learned Men in Forreign Countries, and it is a most ample

Testimony eff the great Worth os the CompilerS, and will de-

serve everlasting praise from all such as have the least Sense of

Vtrtne and Honour.
