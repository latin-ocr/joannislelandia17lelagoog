of Divinity the Year after. He made a Chapell f to be bu·-
riedin. He continued Abbat ’till the time of the Diffolu-
tion, when the Abbey was surrendered up by the Prior, and
not by hlalverne, which perhaps may be the reason why he
had no Penfion allowed him, the King being not willing to
oblige one whom he found so stiff in maintaining the Rights
of the Abbey; tho' had he resigned, there is no doubt buthe
would have bad a very noble Penfion, confidering that he
was a Man striffly virtuous and religiouS. He was the last
Abbat, and lived but a short time after the Diffolution. He
was buried in the before mentioned Chapell on the North
Side of the Prelbytery near the High Altar in the Choir,
where there is a noble Altar Monument to his Memory, with
bis Effigies of white Marble lying on it, with a Mitre and
Crnfier, and these Arms, viz. withina Bordure ingrailed n
Dog passam inter three Pheons.
