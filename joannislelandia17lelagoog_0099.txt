“ THE PLUBLISH‘E'R’S

to'that which was, standing ‘in the time of Julius Caesa'r'.· How-
ever, notwithstanding this Plenty Caesar (w'ho endeavoured ta

had not heard of any Beech in Britain, Hence he tells us that
here was plenty ‹ffallsttch ‘T rees ar grew in Gallia, praeter fagum

judged to be the Place of his Lauding in the Time ff K. Elfred ς
to prove which they preduce a Paffiage ofhis Trarfiation ffOro-

answer to this Objee'tion I observe, Fisst, that it does not ap-
pear to me that the Paffizge out of the Saxon Orofius is of the
Age of King Elfred. Perhaps it might hamstippad in out qs
the same Author nude ψ of by LeIand. Secondly, granting
it to be qfthat Age, yet it is plainly a Mistake, stnce itis against
what Caesar hivfilfafflrts, Thirdb¹. that we at this timeare
much better Interpreters of J nlius Caesar than they were either
in the days os King Elfre‘d, or of the Author in Lelaud, and

eff their Opinion, two Coyns, one of G01d‚ the other qs Silver,
as they are publyhed by Mr. Camden. ‘T hey tell us, that
Camden says they were found about wallingford, and whereas

they do not doubt but that it appears from thence, that Wal-

But in Oppofition to these Afflrtions, I crave leave to olfirw,
first, That Mr. Camden does not acquaint us where these
Coyns were found. Secondly, that tho' he conjeflures that con.

well verfid in the Roman Authors, end knew very well that
Julius Caesar does not lizy, that he was King of the Attrebatii

the seat of this ComiuS, I cannot think that it would have been,

the Thames at it, as thefi’ Authors maintain he did. Thirdly‚
