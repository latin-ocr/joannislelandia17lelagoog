Almost opposite to the last is another Altar Monument oi
Grey Marble, on the T op of which is a Cross carved, and
round the Vcrge are these Words yet remaining, johannes

being gone little can be made out of the Lenem, save the
Imprcffion of these few on the Smne.

Above this was the Monumeut of another Abbat3 but 'tis

On the North Side of the Choir are three ChapellS, and on
the South tw0‚ in one of which is buried Robert Fitz·H:1mon

Countcss of VVarwkk.

Nem· the mgb Altar is an h.1nds0me Monument for George
Duke of Clarence. Brother to King Edward the fourth, and
his Dutchess. Their Effigies lying at Top are handsomely
carved, and opposite to this Monument is a goodly Tomb
of the Lord Obrian and his Lady.
