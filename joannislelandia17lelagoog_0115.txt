A View of the Mitred Abbeys, ‘ ·

He sate Archbishop 27. Years, and lived 94. and was the last
Aschbithop here interred. A farther account of him and his
Predeceffors may be seen in Godwin and Weever.
'Here were also buried Julian Countess of Huntingdon, who
died A0. 1 3 50. and divers of it’s Abbats, whose Epitaphs
may be found in the account of them below ς but eff all thes&
(says Mr. Weever ι) and thoustmds more here interr-’d (this
Abbey having been the ancient place of Inter-ment belonging
to the City, as fituate without the Walls, agreeable to the
Custom of the Primitive Times of Christianity, when they
were not permitted to bury within Cities) not one Bone at
this time remains near another, nor one Stone almost qs the
whole Fabrick stands upon another, the Tra& of that most
good& Foundation no where appear-inm only Ethelbert's Tower,
having escaped the verdi& and Sentence of Destrufflon, was
to be seen when the said Mr. Weever lived, and he judged‚
that tho’ it’s ⁴Beauty was much defaced, it would 'be never·
theless a witness to succeeding Ages of the Magnificenoe of
the whole, when all stood compleat in their Glory together ε
but this Tower fince Weever’s Time, and the Publication of
the Monasticon, (in which {the Draughts of the said Towet Β
and of other Remains of the Monastery are delineated) ie
intirely destroyed, and nothing is now to be seen of the
Abbey except one Sideof the Walls of the said Tower and
some other few Ruins‚ the whole Site being converted into
a Cherry Orchard, (to which the Gate-Houses and outward
Walls serve for an Inclosure) insomuch that no Judgment is
·to be made of the Bigness of the Fabrick of this Church, or
where the Chapells of St. Mary and St. Anne adjoining to it
stood. What else occurs in relation to this Monastery is in·
cluded in the following List of the Abbats.
