Crediton died in the Synod et Kyntlingmne ² (which Dr.
Gibson takes ¹³ to be Kyrtlington in Oxford-ffiire) ΑΟ. 977,

> and was here buried, as 1 have observed before. osgarus

died about the same Year as his Predecess'or the Bissmp af
winchester did, viz. Anno 984. and was succeeded by

7. Enwmus ⁶, who was admitted ΑΟ. 98 ς. He died ΑΟ.
990. (the Saxon Chronicle says d A0. 989.) and was suc-
ceeded the same Year by

8. Wutcnnus ², who died ΑΟ. 1017. (the Saxon (3111011.
says f Anno 1016.) and was succeeded the same Year by

9. Anssmeus Β, 1110’ the saxon Chronicle h tells us that
Wulgarus was succeeded ΑΟ. 1016. by AEthelfigus, who died

’ A0. 10183. and that AdelwinuS, called there AEthelwinus‚

was 01εᾶεά and took place soon after, his Death. This Adel-
winus died A0. 1030. and was sucoeeded by

10. Suum> k, a Monk of Glastonbury. He asted for
some time as Archbilhop of Canterbury, the Administration

of the Affairs thereos being committed to him by Eadfinus ¹ .

the Archbilhop„ Godwin observes Ψ tharA0. 10 58. he was
made Bishop of Rochester; and will. of Malmsbury notes ι·
that he was Bissmp of this See when the Normans came
into England, and that he died soon after. Godwin ἧκες
his Doeth at the Year 107 ς. But both these accounts must
be wrong if the Calculation be right in the History of the
Monastery of Abbington, which places his Death in the Year
1044, and takes no notice of his being Bithop of Rochester.
To prevent Perplexity and Confusson Ι shall follow this ac·
count, (espedauy fince 1 find that it is warranted by the Saxon
Chronicle) and (hall observe from this History that he was
succeeded in the said Year 1044. by ·
1 1. Ετι-ιειετητ ⁰, who died A‘. 1048. (the Saxon Chro-
nicle Ρ says A0. 1046.) and was succeeded the same Year by
12. SPERAroc ιι Monk of St. Edmundtbury. A0. 10 50 r,
(the Saxon Chron. says s ΑΟ. 1048.) he was nominated Bi-

· shop of London, but was refused Consecration by Robert

Arehbissxop of Canterbury. He was eminent for engraving
and painting. Upon his being nominated Bissaop he wan

' succeeded in the Abbatffiip by
