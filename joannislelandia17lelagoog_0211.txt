οέΡιῗέΙΟ burch, (where no doubt was an high Tower) be·
yond which was the Choir, and probably a Chapell dedicated
to St. Mary, was a new Work, tho· the East Parts appeared
to be an old Building.

As to the Monuments in the Abbey Church,1 must not
pretend to be particular on that account, having as yet met
with ιιο better Relation than what ts left us by Leland, who
tells ὓ us, that Rembaldus, Chaucellor to King Edward the
Confeffor and Dean of the College before ιι was convertet!
into an Abbey, was buried in the Body of the Church ιιι a
sepulchre Crosa of white Marble with this Inscription. Hic
jacet Rembaldus presbyter. quondam hujus ecclesie decanus, ὁ
tempore Echnardi Regis Angliae cancellarius.1n another P’lace
he⁴= tells ιιε, that Noblemen of St. Amands were here buried
in the Pretssytery (which was the most Eastern Part of the
Choreb beyond the Choir) and that the heart of sentia, wife
to Richard King of the Romans and Earl of Cornwall, was
bnried m the same Place.

When Sir Robert Atkins was about the Antiquitiet of
Gloocester· shire, I sent him an Account of the Abbats of
thir, as well as of some other Abbeys in that County. But
several material Mistakae have been committed ιιι the print·
ing those Accounts, and therefore when he and 1 are found
to differ from one another, 1 defire that what I now publissa
may be look ’d upon aa much more corre& and complere than
what appears in that work, and that the. Faults to be met
with there were not oocafioned by any Negligence of mine.
