alas! ‘this Charge was really as groundless and weak·
as the former. Itis a very easy T hing to raise scandalous
Stories of any Society. We know what Charat‘ters Mr. Selden
was pleaſsed to hssow upon the Clergy in his Preface to his
Histoty of Tithes· He was famous for his Learning, and his
Authority was the more likely to do misthief. And yet hefouneI,
to his very great Regret‚ such Advocates in behaff of the Cler-
gy, as tho’ Clergy·men themselves were yet equa! to him in
Learning, and much suberior in Judgment. Were all Stories

Clergy and other learned Bodies, our Univerfities would quickijt

we distoutss: of learned Bodies these ought not to be confidered, ,
at least their Ignorance ought not to be looked upon as suffl-
cient to denominate them unlearned. Aed to this thatsome·
times thofir illiterate Perseus were eminent upon some other Ac*
count, and consequently might prove very serviceable to the
' MonastetieS. ffler all, it is ve‘ry certain that a great Numher

'to account sor that incredible Number of Book: written by
them, No one that reads either Boston of Bury, or Leland,
'sor other Authors that stry any thing of their erting8‚ 'can
Jzfily suppose them to have been illiterate Men. On the contrary,
many 'of theirWritings are veryjudicious andfull of Learning,
and what many of the lest of our modern Writers (notwith-
standing the many Advnntages we have sor acquiring Learn-
ing that they wanted) need not be afhamed of. Nay in some
Parts ofLearning they exceeded any of our Moderns; which
is an Argument, not only os excellent Parts, but os their con·
