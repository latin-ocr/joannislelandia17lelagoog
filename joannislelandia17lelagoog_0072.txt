PRAELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.

'ff Study which dependi upon inspefiing and cotfielting old MSS.

in cheHing Fragments from MSS. I should think it advise-
able (provided the Opinion ofsp ignorant and mean a Persou
as my Jelf may be of any weight) to be very particular in ex·
mining those MSS. which are either written in a very rude
Hand, or are pretty much defaced3 because, in my own searchee,
J have always oistrved that unpublilhed fragments are
mre frequently found in such Kind of MSS. than in those that
are written fairly and are oefily read. And this J have noted

not only with restet? to our own History, but alfia with re· ·

gard to other Parts ff Antiquity. The mention whereas brings
to my memory a Fragment of the Greek Ans ‘f St. Thecla
abac is omitted in both the Editions gfthe Spicilegium Patrum ⁸,
that was colleiied and set out by ‘thesate pious and learned
Dr. Grabe. I told him ff it some years before he dyed ( when
Ι was transtribing and colleffiing for him many other Frag-
ments belides out of other MSS.) and he took a Note of it, and
said he would take care to make it publick when an Opportu-
nity ffered. The MS. in which ’tis efflant is amongst those
purchased by the Univerfity ff Oxford out of the Study of Dr.
Hnntingdon. ’vs a thick Qarm, and contains divers other
valuable Remaius of Ecclefiastical Antiquity. ’vs above 500.
Tears old, (as I conjectus-e) and is written in a pretty large
Charac'ier, and the orthography is agreeable to the Pronun-
ciation in use when the Scribe lived, but in several Places
the Letters are sp much decayed that 'tis hard to make them
out. The Greek MS. Dr. Grabe himseff madeuse <ff happened
to be imperfefk, and he was therffore obliged to supply ie
srom MetaphrasteS, which had been more lnckily done from
this MS. of Dr. Huntingdon, had he been so happy as to have
known ff it at that time. But because ’twill be more Satis-
fafiion to the Reader (however it may seem to be a Digres-
fion) to have it publilhed, than to have it still lye hid in the
MS. I beg leave to insert it here, not in the least doubting
but that it will be kindly received by all true Lovers of Eccle-
fiastical Learning andAntiquity: and that the rather, because
· Ι will not alter either the manner of writing or pointing, but
retain all the Errors of the MS. Which Method, if it were
followed in publishing other old MSS. (at least by way os
specimen either in the Preface or Notes) it would be a good
Rulefhr others to judge of their Antiquity, as well as the way
of Pronunciation at that time, it being certain, as I take it,
that the Accents in their Books, however they may differ
from the stated way of Accenting now, arefiaere Arguments
that they did not pronounce their Words otherwfi than they
