With a Caealogne eff their RespeHioe Abbats. 21 ς

Fonndation, chiefly bemuse it was the Burial Place of King
osvald, who was ssain ⁸ on the ninth of August Anno 64 2.
Bede tells us that over his Tomb was a Banner of Gold and
Purple, and indeed it cannot be conceived, what a Multi-
tude of Vifitants flocked hither after he had been interr’d in
this Hace, every one being willing to pay his Res pe& to a
Prince so eminently good and virtuous. But 1 58. Years after
the Building of this Monastery, viz. Anno 870, those two
nooed Danilh PrinceS, Inguar and Hubba, totally destroyed
it, murdering all the Monks and burning the Church to the
Ground. After which it continued thus desolate and unin-
habited no less than 24 ς. Year8‚ when Gilbert de Gan: Β,
'Earl of Lincoln, A0. 1 1 1 5. restored it, rebuilding the same,

· and very amply endowing it, as did his Son and Heir Wal-
ter, who succeeded him in the Earldom.

Befides St. Oswald were likewise buried in this Monastery‚

, 1. Quen Ostrytb‚ Wife to King Ethelred the founder, after
ihe had been murdered by the Danes c Ao. 697. 2. Ethel-
red ¹ Husband of the said Qeen Ostryth, who resigned his
Kingdom A0. 704. professed himself a Monk‚ and at length
A0. 712. founding this Monastery became the first Abbat
thet-eof. He died A‘. 716. Both he and his Qeen are num-
bred among the Saxon δαίτης. 3. Gilbert de Gant θ, Ne-
phew to william the conqueror. He died in the time of
King wmiam Rufum There is no doubt but all these as well
as divers others that were here interi-'d had stately Monu-
ments. But all of them as well as the Abbey it self (cncept
a very inconfiderable Part of it) are now come to Ruin and
Deca .

Tge Abbats of this Place had many privileges, and were·
‘in ancient Times styled Lords of Lindsey. I shall divide my
catalogue of them into two Paris, the first whereof shall re-
late to the Abbats after the Foundation of King Ethelred3
and the other to those after the Foundation of Gilbert de
Gant. 1 have endeavoured to obtain a compleat account of
the first3 but the Memoriais of t'nose Times that 1 have yet
met with bein nothing near so full and exa& as Icouid
wiffi, 1 must e content with the Names of three or font

⁰ only, and leave the rest to future Discovery.
