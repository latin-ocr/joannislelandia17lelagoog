that it was ernost goodly Abbey, 1 (hall give a lhort account
of it from Leland ²: =

‘⁴ The Abbey Church is a right magnificent thing, where
⁸⁸ were two Steeplcs, one that had a mighty high Pyt-amis,
⁸⁶ and fen dangeroussy down in hominurn memoria. It stood
‘⁶ in the middle ocf the Church‚ and was a Mark to all the
θ’ Country about. The other Steeple is a great square Tower
‘⁸ at the West End of the Choreb-'³

‘⁸ There b were in the Abbey Church Yard two other
⁸⁴ ChurcheS, one of which was a little Church joining to the
⁴⁸ South Side of the Abbey Church.”

“ The ⁰ other stands at some distance.” After the Diss‘o-
lution the same Author tells us, that one Sturnp, an exeeed
ing rich Clothier‚ bought the Lodgings of the Abbey of the
King, ancl that all -the Abbey Offices were full of Looms to
weave Cloath, and that he intended to make a Street or two
for Clothiers of the vacant Ground of the Abbey, and that
Weavers had Loorns in the little Church. This Sturnp, he
also informs us, was the chief Causer and Contributer to
have the Abbey Church made a Paristx Church.

The Remains of this noble Abbey Church may be seen
by the Draught in the Monasticon‚ which tho’ it be not
above a third Part of it, yet it plainly ihews it to have been
ι most goodly Struc‘ture, and equal, if not superior, to most
of our cathedrals in England. The Spire Steeple in the
Middle and Tower at the West End made it very much re·
feuible the Cathedral of Hereford3 but these as well as the
great Cross me, Choir‚ CloysterS, and Chapter-House being
au intirely demolilhed, that part which yet standeth is the
Body or Nave of the Church‚ and is walled up at each End
between the *two Steeple3‚' being in Length about 140. Feet‚
and about 100. in Breadth.

The Abbacy and the other Offices are much ruined, the
whole Town decayed, and the Mai-ket in a great measure lost.
The chief Ornament of the Town, befides this Church, is
the goodly Market CrosS.

To the Description we have given we must add, That
the Abbey confisted of a very large spatious Bocly, with a
fine Western Front and Tower, a large Steeple in the middle
Cross Isse and Choir ὅτε. and that the Steeples were reple·
nished with large Bells, no less than ten'whereof were, as
the inhabitants say, in the Middle Tower‚ and two in the
western one. On one of the ssells belonging to this Abbey
was this Inscription z
