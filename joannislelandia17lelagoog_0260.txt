This Chnrch escaping at the Diffolution was converted by
the Parishioners, who purchased it of the King, into a Paro·
chial Church. But the Cloysters, Chapter-muse, Abbacy‚
Lady Chapell at the East End, and all the other Buildings
were destroyed, excepting the Cato-Hense, which is a very
noble one, and is called the Prista-Hense, and is above 40.
Feet in Height, and is embattelled at Top.

The Church is a large and curious Fabrick, being hullt 111

Dimalion& which are as follow. The Length of the Choreb,
as itis at present, from East to West, is 300. Feet3 but when
