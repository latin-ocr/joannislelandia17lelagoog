the Yoer 1 524. and was bere butico under a · noble Monu-
ment. He was succeeded by

39. Tuo. WooLsssr b who was elested Abbat 30. Nov.
ι 526. He was a Person of adinary Extrafflon, but of vast
Abssities. By his excellent Natural Parts, exquifite Loerning,
profound Judgment, indefatfigable Industry‚ genteel Beba-
viour, and undaunted Coun-age and Resolution he acquired
such a Reputation as made him taken notice of by the Κίος
andothers of the highest Birth and Qality. So that in a
little time he vas advanced to the most confides-able Posss of
Honour, and the whole Management of the Publick Affiifs
vas intirely committed to himz which created hi1'n so many
Enemies (who all envied his Glory) that, notwithstanding
his Eloquence and Policy, he was at 12st deprived of an his
Places, which eonduced in no small measure to the Ihm-ming
of his Days. We have very few, if any, amongst au our
Britissa W'orthies that may be compared with'him for Gene-
τοῦτ’ and Hospitality. He was of such an Heroick and Pu-
buck spirit, that it was his constant Endeavour that his Be-
uefastions should be equal to the Groetness of his income.
Posterity fland amazed when they view the Bnildings he
ereaed ς which however are onlyan Earnest of what he in·
moed, had he not fallen under the Displeasnre of his Royzl
