PRAELIMINARY OBSERVAT lONS.

avacancy there is sor another D. between D. and N ERO·
N ls in the first Editition, tho’ not olglerved in the late Dutch
EAEtion. I cannot alst> upon this occasion omitt taking notia
a( these two Abbreviations (Β Α A ο) in a Coyne ff Britan·
nicus, publishedfirli by strada, and afterwardt by Mr. Boltou
in his Life of Nero Caesar. Strada was at a lo s to know the‘
meaning of theſs.- Abbreviations, but ΜΓ. Bolton (who was

. a very sagacious Man) bath veryfortunately gueffld it at, in

pag. 1 34. of the soresttid Book, where the Coyn is ingravedat
large, and the Inferi ption on the Reverse at sullis as follows .-
ΜΕΤΡΟΠΟΛΕΣΕΤΙΜΙΝΑΙΟΥΒΑΛΟ, i. e. μυη- vom (the ε he·
ing to be changed into ι) -Ετιμιναίε βασιλέως ivor, from ,which
also the Ceyn ff Britannicus in Camden may hesupplyed and il·
lustrated. Now if this he the true and genuine Meaning ff the
Inscription, (as Isee no reason, at present, to question but ie
is) it will shew London to have been a Metropolis, and to
have been famous even in Caesar’s Days, contrary to what is
conumnly maintain’d. At the same time Ι am confidet-ing this
Inscription Ι have likewise an opportunity offered of inserting
ι Coppet Coyn ff Britannicus out of Consu! Ray's Coyns in
the Bodleian Libraty, which I shall do the more readily, be·
catgse Coyns of this young Prince are extremely rare, and are ’

{remed b y the most accurate Judges as very great Trea·
et.

 

Ι might produce other Instances to confirm what Ῑ have here
said about the Additions that might be made to those that
have written about the Signification of abbreviated Words in
Inscriptions ς but I shall wave all farther Discourse npon this
Topick, and will only crave leave to infert here an old· In·
scription that was communicated to me hy my learned and wor-
tlor Friend Roget Gale, Esq; which tho· it be already pub-
hyhed hy him in his Edition of Antoninus’s Itinerary thro'
Britain ⁸, yet he having not then seen it himself, the Transtript
he at that time made ψ of happened to be very faulty, which
is in this Capy (taken by his own Care and Direffion) very

bappibv corrcfled‚ and therq‘ore, as is presumcd, be not at all
unacceptable.
