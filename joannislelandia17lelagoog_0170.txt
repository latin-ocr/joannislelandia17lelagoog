mth a catalogue ff their Respenive Abbats.

This is certain, that out of all the printed ones 1 have con·-
sulted 1 have been able to recover but one, and that is Li-
vingus ι, who praessded here 54. Years after the Foundation.
After which the Abbey being destroyed, it continued in
Ruina ’till the time of King Edgar aforesaid. It is from this
Per-iod that my catalogue must commence 3 but before 1
enter upon it, 1 presume it will not be amiss to transcribe
the Account Leland hath left us of this Place‚ and to make
two or three Reman-ks of my own.

“ Kenulph, Kiug of the Mercians,” (saith this admirable
Antiquary ”‚) “ had a Pallace in thisTowne, and builded here
“ a famous Abbey, which was very solemnly dedicated.
“ ’Twas twice defaced by Fire and reedifyed. There lie bu·
‘⁸ ried in the East Part of the Church Qf this Monastery Ke-
“ nelph and Kenelm, the F ather and Son, both Kings of Mer-
“ cia, and at the East End of the High Altar in St. Nicho·
“ las’s Chapell one Henry Boteler, who covered the Bod
“ of the Church with Lead. There was of ancient tymea
‘ Church os St. Nicholas in the East Part of the Town, which
“ being decayed‚ the Paristi Church of the Town was kept in
“ the Body of the Church of the Monastery, ’till the time of
“ Heu. VI. when william Winchombe‚ Abbat‚ began, by
‘⁸ consent of the Toum, a Parilh Church anthe West End of
“ the Abbey (where a Chapell of St. Pancras stood) and made
“ the East End of it. The Parishioners had gathered 200l. and
‘⁸ began the Body; but that Sum being not enough to per-
“ form so expensive and costly a Work, Ralf Boteler‚ Lord
“ Sudley, helped them, and finilhed it. This Parish Church
“ was dedioeted to St. Peter.'’

Ι have been the more inclined to borrow this passage from
Leland, because it clears what Sir Robert Atkins hath been
pleased to observe about the Church, who hath expreffed
himself with so little cautiori, that one would think from his
Account that the present Parilh Church was the Abbey
Church ; and yet his saying that it is dedicated to St. Peter.
and the Abbey Church to St. Mary, is a proos to such as well
consider it that he thought otherwise himself.

The mention of Sir Robert Arkins gives me occasion to
corre& a Mistake committed by him with reference to the
Manuos· of the Abbey. He tells us that Anno 1608. it was
in Poffeffion of the Crown, and that Dr. Lloyd, Chancellor
of the Dioces of Worcester, was Lord os it in 1710. As soon
aslhad read this Particular‚ I began to enquire about the
truth of it, and the Result of my Inquiry is this, viz.
