A· Vm» of the mima Abbeyf.

sttuuld be the first Abbarin E'ngland in Order and Dignity.
After which Pope Honorius ΑΟ. 12 ιθ. confirmed rothe Ab·
bat aad his Successore Episcopal Righoes, and exempted them
from the jurisdiction of the Bilhopof Lincoln their Dioce-
san. They had likewise allowed- them their Seats in parlia-
ment ’till- the Diss'olution, and accordingly ver-y often sub-
seribed before the other Abbats‚ notm'thssanding some were
elder in Croation. ¹ ’

The l'rivileges of this· Monastery being, as before men·
tioned‚ ver-y great, the M‘onlts took« no less care to adom
magnificently their Buildings, which w-in be seen more par·
ticnlarly in theLives of the Abbats, who were the chief Pro·-
moters of this Grandeur. The structure of the Chutch stin·
tamine, being the chief· Ornament os the Tomi, and‘ owee
it’s Preservation‚ no doubt, to it’s last Abbat Boreman's pur·
clnfing it;·and pity it is that the CloysterS, Chapter-House,
and other Offices were not likewise preserved from the Sacri-
legious 'Hands of those Persons who have intirely der'no·
liched them. As to the Monkish Verses and Historical
Paitgtings in the CloysterS, Library, διε. taken from the Bible
andPortraitures of famous Men in the Wirfflows, they may
be·seen in the Monafficon·, which 1 shall- therefore pass
by, and only take notice that t'nose Buildings seem το· have
been ofa newer and more elegant structure than the Abbey-
Charch it sels, as were, no doubt, the Abbacy and other
Offiees‚ whose Gate is· now standing, and is very large, lead·
ing to the Town Goal, which, with the Church, are the only
Remains of the Abbey. - —

The Shrine δ of St. Alban was also very sumptuouz, as
were the Altar and Brass Font brought out of Scotland and
scarce to be equalled in any Church. The first is intirely
gone, and there is only this inscribed on a modern black
Marble ε δαηὲῖω Albanus Verolametfis Anglorum Proto-mar·
tyr 17· Jun. ccxcxu. The Stone-Work of the Altar is yet
remaining, and is very stately, and well wrought; but all the
Golden and Silver ornaments are gone. As to the latter,
there is one preserved in Wood which represents the Fa-
shion and Make of the Brass one. 1 shall not here mention
the Epitaphs of · those Noble Persons that were ssain in those
two famous Battles between the Houses of York and Lan-
caster, and here buried; but rather desire the-Reader to con·
sult Channcy and Weever‚ and instead of inlargin'g on thie
account, lwill beg leave to observe, that this is one of
the Religious Houses restored by Qeen Mary, tho' it con·
tinued not above a twelve Month after. · · · ·
