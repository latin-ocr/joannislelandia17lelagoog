The Abbey of Tewksbury was of great Antiquity‚ For we
find ⁸ that Anno 71 5. a rengione House was built here to the
Honour of the bleffed Virg‘m by Oddo and Doddo Dukes of
Mercia in the Time of Ethelred, Kenred and Ethelbald Kings
of the said Province. The said Oddo and Doddo died in the
Year 725. and were buried at Persore in worcester-(hire.

Hugh b, Earl of Mercia, who flourished about the Year
800. procur'd Brichtric, King of the Westsssaxons, to be bu·
ried in the Chapell of St. Faith’s in this Priory. He died An.
812. and was buried on the North Side of the Body of the
Church. Anno 930. a Nobleman, named Haylwardus snew
from his fair Complexion, built a Monastery at Craneborn,
to thch he subjested this Priory of Tewksbury of which
he was Patron. He was succeeded by Algar his Son, and
Algar by Brichtric, who held this town at the Time of the
Conquest3 bnt the conqueror disposs'effing him of it, it was
giech by Will. Rufus to Robert Fitz·Hamon, who in the
Year 1102. new built this Church and Monastery‚ making it
an Abbey, and subjefflng the Abbey. of Craneborn aforesaid
to it. At the same time he took care to have it dedicated to
the virgin Μαι-γ, and endowed it with many Laude and Pos-
seffions, which were valued at the Suppreffion at 1 5981. rs.

Prion-y, and Tewksbury into an Abbey ; so that Cranebom
was nothing else afterwards but a cell to Tewksbury, which .
became very famous, and continually receiv’d new Honours .
from many religious and noble PersonS, who were capable of
affing very generoussy by reason of the Plentiful Estates God
had bleffed them with. ·

' Benefaaor to this Abbey, as likewise was Robert‚ base Son

' of Hem-y 1. who by Marriage of Mabinc, eldest Daughter
