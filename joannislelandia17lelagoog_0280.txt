I acquainted you at Oxford that 1 had compared Dr, Muf-
graves’s copy of the Inscription of Julius Vitalis with the ori-
ginal at Rath, and found it pretty accurate, and indeed the
most ⁶ exa& of any yet published, the differences being very
immaterial. 1 than here give you an account of two more
published in the Ninth Volume of your Leland, both which*
1 also viewed at that place. The first is

a vide Moreton's Histoi-y of Northasnptonffi. p. 503. b V. spelmanni
Icenia p. 157. c But 1 am otherwise infor-med bv three other Perseus, οηρ
of which is Mr. Gale's Brother, and another Mr. o‘ddy‚ and a third a Clergy
Man, who are posttive that the true reading is that which is publissted m
the Eighth Vol. of Lelaud's ltin. from the Cop sent me by the said Mr.
Gale's Brother and Mr. oddy. Mr. oddy adds, t at the Account 1 receiv‘d
