We leam from Lelmd ⁶ md the Monasticon ¹¹, and itit ob·
sen-ved too by Dr. Tannet- ε, that this Abbey was founded by
King Canute, and dedicated ιο St. Edmund in the Yenr 1020.

Account in Speed ²3 36.1. 16.s. ’Twas an immense and
incredible Sum of Money that the King raised by the Supss
preffion of the Abbeys. For befides ¹ the Houses and Laudi»
taken away from the Religious, there was much Money
made of the present Stock of Cattel and Corn, of the Tim·
her, Lead, nens, acc. and chiefly of the Plato and Churcb
orn-meatu which tho· it be not wlnod, yet we may make
some Conjesture what it was only by this Monasteryof St..
Edmundtbury, from which was taken (as we ate informent,
by the Records) five thousand Marks of Gold and Silver, be-
fidee divers stenes of great value. All which (saith the noble
Historiam) being by some openly called Rapine and sacrilege
