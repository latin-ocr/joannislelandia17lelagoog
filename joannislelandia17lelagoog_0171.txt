A V‘oew ff the Mirm! Abba-ys,

'rim the Μιιιὲιοιοε wznchetcombe with the sne of the
Abbey belonged to the Lord Chandos soon after the Diffe-
-lution, and that it continued in that Family ’till the Year
1654. When on the nath of George Lord Chandos with·
out Iss'ue it came by his Gift to his Widow and Reli& jane,
Daughter of John Earl Rivers, who afterwards marrying with
George Pitts Esq3 of Stratfeild·Sey Com. Southampt. {he
brought it to that Family, or at least her Hustvand enjoyed
it in her night. And as to D‘. Lloyd, he held this Mannor
only by virtue of a considerable Lease which was purchased
by his first Wife’s Relations named Poland3 and so he was

· no more than a Leasehold Tenant of the Mannor for a Term ·

of Years which is now expired.

The Paristt Church above mentioned is still standing3 but
the Abbey hath been long fince demolithed, and the Site
turned into arable Ground. 1 have endeavoured to procure

“ a Draught of the Abbey, that by that means we might un·

derstand what a Sort of Fabrici< it was. But my Attempts
this way have proved very unsuccessful, notwithstanding Ι
went thither, with no other Defign, in September ¹7¹4· I
surveyed the Ground where it stood (which was on the North
Enst-fide of the Church) very exactly, arld tho· 1 could not
meet with so much aa a Stone standing, yet it was no small
Satisfastion to me that 1 had walked over the soil on which
this large Pile of building was ereeted, and where there had
been formerly such a Number of Persona (famous for their
Bit-th, Learning, Piety and Virtue) interred, which Thing
alone one wouldthink might have commanded Reverence,
and deterred those that were imployed soon after the Diffe-
lution (by the Lord Seymour, as 1 conceive) to pull it down
and destroy it. As 1 was pursuing these Religious InquirieS,
1 accidentally met with a venerable old Man, who direfied
me to the Place where the Church stood, and told me that
he had frequently heard, particularly when he was a Youth,
that the Tower of it was large and fine, but that there was
nothing left standing of the Abbey within his own Memory
except a few OfficeS, which were probably those where the
Abbat’s Head Hine or chief Ploughman lived.
