referring to something that followed but is now lost, the Stone
having been squared ² when set into the present wall of the
Town. After the second O in COLON is a flaw in the

Stoue, which occafioned the diminithing that letter as above.
As to the second, which is that of SVCC PETRON the

a Itis very ralh fer any one, especially for Schola-s, to attempt the
Alteration of ancient Monuments that they may be the more conveniently
placed. Truly learned and jndicious Men make great nse of tlte Forat
and rigure of the stenes, aad when any of the XVords are' wanting they
will from the Bigness gather what the Omiffions are, anti uin give pro-
bable Gne-(ses how they are to be supplyed. My Lord Arundcl was very
cautious in this Affatir. He knew the true [se to ize trade of ancientMar-bles.
He did not therefore make the least Alter-&tion in so much as one of amre
he purchased. But on the contrary he laid his lnjunstions upon those that
were to courcy them over, and to fix them afterwards, to preserve thern
intire as they were found. He did not think the least Bit of f. att-blesu-
perlluous. Neither would he suffer any Letter to be either renewed or de·
faccd. [t is therefore very much to be lamentcd‚ that the same care hah
not been taken by others of such kind of monuments ; hut that they have
been permit.c.l to be cut and man led and otheru ise altered, for which
