nfirstfs time, and built that part of the Monastery that was
called Rorman’s lsse, not to mention a great number more,
nor to inlarge upon· many other particulam of the History
and Antiquities of this Abbey, which may be met with at
large in the ⁸ monasticon and in the Englilh Historiansb pu-

solution, it met with no better luck than the rest, it being
now. so utterly destroyed, that little of it is left, save aGate-
House, which is thatched‚ and is said by the Inhabitants to
have been a Prison. The Manor House, now belonging to
the Heirs of Cou. Titus, with the Offices διε. were built of

the RuIns of the Abbey. not far from which is the Parim
Choreb, which is in Height ἰ 20. Feet, and {n Broedth'46.

lt confists of a Body and Chaucell of equal Height which '
‚are tyled, and two Side Isles which are leaded. At the West “ ·

'End is aTower about 64. Feet high, which was built about ι
the Year 1671. by the lnhabitants with the Abbey Stone.
Before this it was a low, wooden Bmlding, in which hung
four Bella, which on creffting the Stone -Tower were with
'additional Mettal cast into five. Here are no Monuments (ι-

Church. But in this they are very much mistaken, the Abbey
Church having been much finer and moro magnificent.
