53. anp HAroRn, HAwt-onn‚ alias BALLARD ·,. a
young Monk of this House, who thereby commencing Abbat
Anno ¹539· yielded up the same to the King's Use (much to
the Discontent of Lichfeild) and had not only a Penfion of
24ol. per an. but afterwards the Deanery of Worcester con·
ferred on him, which he held ’till his Death, which happened
Anno ι 5 57. He was the last Abbat of this House, and was bu·
ried at Worcester. When 1 was at Worcester 1 was lhewed
his Monument‚ which is the Effigies of a Man cut in Stone,
with a Mitte aud Crofier‚ lying on an Altar Monument. Itis
in a Chapell on the South Side of the Choir. 'rho‘ there be
no Inscription to confirm this Account‚ yet the Person that
shewed the Church affured me that it had been a constant
Tradition that it was for the last Abbat of Evesham.
