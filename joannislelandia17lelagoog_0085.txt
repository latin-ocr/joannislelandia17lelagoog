THE PUBLISHER’S·

Honses not at all touch’d upon there, might be illustrated, and
stt in a clear and proper Light. Nay divers Remarks ff very
great moment may be extraHed both from Mr. Leland's Iti·
nerary and from, his Collestanea, which are not mentioned
there. ’Τίς true the Compilers conficited both those Worksr

but then whether it was because they wanted an Index, or else ·

because they had not opportunity and Leisure to examine those
Books with all the Niceness and Sn·i&ness as was requisite,
or whatever else may be the reaſsm, this is certain, that itst
fell out, that many excellent and useful Materials to be met

with in those V olumes escaped their Diligence, and might there·

'forefirve to make up one Part of the Improvements that

might be made to the Work. But then there is this Discourage·
ment, that Books of this nature are frequentin as it hap·
pens, a long time in vending‚ and the Undertdters, for that
reason, in danger of being ruined. And ’tis probable that, tho·
no one should, as I observed before, sequester himstffffifar as
to deny his Service to the Public, yet this may be' the true rea·
fin why no one bath, as yet, pretended to publisb another Part.
Itis obfi’rvable that in this Nation many Works are proposed
and commended as very laudable and necessary, and the Com·
pilers and Undertakers are according& usually applaudet! sor
their great and laborious Attempts3 but when the Works are
brought to Perfecfiion and ready for Publication, many ff those,
that were almost extravagant bffore in praistng them, prove
οηζγ pretended FrIends, andare sb far from helping off with
the Impreffion, that they rather ieje all clandestine Means
they can to hinder and prevent the Sale. Infidious Adversaries
are most ff all to be seared ‚- and Petybns of this Dispofition

and Tem per may most properly be charafferized as such. It is
lamentable to consider the Difficulties Gruter met with in the

Sale ff his admirable Collec‘tion of InscriptionS. The Chat-ges
of the Edition could not be ballanced ’till many years aster
his Death. But that which is more deplorable than this is the
Fate ffthe learned Dr. Edmund Castell, who aster many Years
spent in compiling his Hep·aglott Lexicon, to the ruining ff
‘his Health and Fortune, when the Work was finilhed and
published be met with a very poor Rewardsor his incredible
and indeed Herculean Labours. Himsdsobserves in a Letter
I have under his own Hand, that he had spent above twelve
thousand Pounds upon that er, and makes bitter Complaints
that after such a vast Expense, and so many Disasters as he had
enconntered with in it, the Copies should af! lye upon his
Hands. Which complaints as they were very just, and in·
deed much to the Scandal of those that were able to he Patrons

of Learning, fi they may bc as truly made in many cotsher
